                        <p>At Young STEM Professionals, we have created a fun and engaging enrichment program for kids ages 5 - 17 by using two major components. First, Young STEM Professionals provides education advancement and introduces young adults and
                            children to Science, Technology, Engineering and Math. In our programs, participants will enhance their problem-solving skills, perform hands-on activities in project-based learning, and explore the world of potential STEM-related
                            career paths and opportunities.</p>

                        <p>Our second component involves providing youth leadership development training activities where participants will perform exercises in trust building, communication skills, conflict resolution, effective supervisory skillsets, teamwork,
                            and understanding leadership roles.</p><br>

The instructors have created a safe inclusive space for our young ladies ages 11-18 to engage in STEM project-based learning while increasing their self-efficacy. The organization has also created a pathway for students to consider pursuing career opportunities in STEM through early exposure. We are very grateful for the collaboration."</p>

                        <p>"For the past 5 years, I have had the pleasure to be a part of the Young STEM Professionals and Engineering for Kids. I love watching students learn and develop innovative creations of their own. As technology grows, and the world changes around us, I often learn with the students. While working with Engineering for Kids, I was honored to be Teacher of the Month in 2020. I am excited to be an instructor with Young STEM Professionals and I enjoy my time working with the children of the community that Young STEM Professionals serves."</p>
